# Shell Game


## Description

The goal of this game is to guess which cup the ball is in, after the cups are shuffled.

The ball starts in the middle cup. Click the "Shuffle Cups" button to begin the game. 
After the cups have shuffled, click a cup to see if it contains the ball!

There are no hints. Once the game begins, the only way to see which cup has the ball is
to correctly guess, and click the right cup. 

The cups have no pattern, the ball location is always random. The ball will always stay
in the same cup... no tricks.

The score represents your win streak. To increase you score above 1, you must correctly guess 
the right cup multiple times in a row.
