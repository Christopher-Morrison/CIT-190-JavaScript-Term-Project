# Mini Tetris Game


## Description

The goal of this game is to get 5 blocks in a row. This will result in the row being 
deleted, and a point being awarded.

If the blocks make it to the red line at the top, its game over!

## Bugs
There is an elusive bug where some phantom blocks may exist.
It is also possible for blocks to exist in the same space if they are moved while
they are kitty corner to each other. 


## Future updates
I will attempt to address these bugs, however there is no guarentee that they will
be fixed.


## Usage

You can use the arrow keys to move left and right.
