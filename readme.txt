# Capstone Project


## Description

This project showcases my use of HTML, CSS, and Javascript/JQuery.
A main page links to three different minigames, each using different languages learned in class.

Tetris
A tetris game with somewhat limited capability. I'm not sure I'd be able to make the entire thing scroll downwards.

Pong
A fun left to right pong game. Potentially two players

Cup
A ball will be placed in a cup, follow it with your eyes as it is shuffled. Difficulty may be variable.


## Usage

Click on the game to open the minigame, hover for a description.
